# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains **my personal solutions** to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems. I aim to improve my skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) by completing each problem. **My main language choice is [`C++`](https://cplusplus.com/)** as it is a relatively low level language while providing a rich standard library for DSA. I followed [NeetCode's Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) to serve as my first few steps in solving LeetCode problems.

## Repository Structure

```bash
leetcode/ # repository
|--####-####/ # problem number (0001-0100)
|  |--####-problem-title.* # solution file
|--README.md # this documentation file
|--... # other files...
```

This repository uses a bucketed directory structure, grouping problems by 100s for easier navigation. The `other files...` refer to tools or other metadata files that are not the main focus of the repository. Each important subdirectory not explained here will have their own `README.md` documentation file.
